Or when you pass the cupboard-place beneath the attic stairs;

Round the house too,
She’ll want to see the kitchen

Find a tiny present
To give her when she goes,
They love silver paper
And little ribbon bows.

I knew a little girl once
Who saw twenty-three
Playing in the orchard
As jolly as could be.

They asked her to dance with them
To make a twenty-four;
She ran to the nursery
And hid behind the door.

Hid behind the nursery door—

She grew up very solemn
And rather ugly too.

If you meet a fairy
Remember what I say,
Talk to her nicely
And don’t run away.

As down to earth she goes;

And sometimes sings a song or two
And sometimes has a doze.

But at the earliest crow of cock
Back to the sky the fairies flock,
And at their doors they stand and knock

Mid plentiful treasure of fruit and of flower;
But you shall have pleasaunces brighter than these,

Your gown is of crimson, your shoes are of gold;
But a mantle of rainbows shall wrap you about,
Besprinkled with star-dust within and without.

Your ladies-in-waiting are gracious and fair
And a little page stands by the side of your chair;
But an army of goblins shall do your behest
And fly at your bidding to East and to West.
.pm new-page 018

You shall sit on a cushion of velvety moss,
Embroidered with sunbeams across and across,
And a grasshopper chorus shall make you good cheer
Or charm you with delicate lullabies, dear.

I will tap at your window some moon-silvered night,
And when you lean down through the jessamine white
My fairy-swift wings I shall softly unfurl
And bear you away to my palace of pearl.

I spied the tiny tailor who makes the fairies’ frocks;
There he sat a-stitching all the afternoon
And sang a little ditty to a quaint wee tune:
  “Grey for the goblins, blue for the elves,
  Brown for the little gnomes that live by themselves,
  White for the pixies that dance upon the green—
  But where shall I find me a robe for the Queen?”

All about the garden his little men he sent,
Up and down and in and out unceasingly they went.
.pm new-page 020
Here they stole a blossom, there they pulled a leaf,
And bound them up with gossamer into a glowing sheaf.
  Petals of the pansy for little velvet shoon,
  Silk of the poppy for a dance beneath the moon,
  Lawn of the jessamine, damask of the rose,
  To make their pretty kirtles and airy furbelows.

Never roving pirates back from Southern seas
Brought a store of treasures home beautiful as these.
They heaped them all about him in a sweet gay pile,
But still he kept a-stitching and a-singing all the while:
  “Grey for the goblins, blue for the elves,
  Brown for the little gnomes that live by themselves,
.pm new-page 021
  White for the pixies that dance on the green,
  But who shall make a royal gown to deck the Fairy Queen?”

In the meadows here and there,

Elfin lines of gossamer
  Stretch between the grasses;
And if you will look about
  Soon you will discover
Fairy washing hanging out
  All among the clover.

In the quiet woods you might,

On a lily-leaf, perchance,

Practising her tiny dance
  For the evening revel.

Its constant emerald mocks at the skies;
Though they be garmented grey or blue
Never the Green Loch changes hue;
For at earliest dawn, when the winds are still,
Over the brow of the western hill
The fairies come in a happy throng
With elfin laughter and elfin song
Trooping down to the water-side
To bathe in its cool enchanted tide.
Over and under they flash about,
They race with the shy little silver trout,
They twist and tumble and dart and dive
Till all the lake is alight and alive,
And glows with a tremulous sparkling sheen
Like the jewelled robe of an Eastern queen.
.pm new-page 025

But ere the morning has well begun
They all come leaping forth to the sun.
They hang for a shimmering moment there
Shaking their curls in the warm bright air,
While the water drops from their delicate wings
And dapples the lake with quivering rings,
Then rise like thistledown over the trees
And float away on the heather-sweet breeze.

They leave not a sign, they leave not a trace,
A slumberous calm lies over the place;
Only the green, green waters bide
To tell the secret they never can hide.

Waiting the moment that shall bring the freedom of the skies;
Waiting the double-sweet delight that only he can give—
(Oh, kings might surely spurn their crowns to live as fairies live).
.pm new-page 027

To ride upon a skylark’s back between his happy wings,
To float upon the edge of heaven and listen while he sings—
The dreams of mortals scarce can touch so perfected a bliss,
And even fairies could not know a greater joy than this.

Among her curls he bobbed about

This is a common sight perchance

It seemed to draw no curious glance

Along the street I watched her go

And still he tumbled to and fro

Is really not a cat at all; it’s only a disguise.
A witch cast a spell on him a long time since
And changed him to a pussy-cat; but once he was a Prince.

On warm clear nights when a big moon is out
He steps into the garden and never turns about,
But walks down the path with his quiet proud air—
He knows that the fairies are waiting out there.

The fairies go a-dancing, a-dancing in a ring,
He sits in the middle with a crown like a king,
High on a throne in the middle of the grass,
And the fairies stop capering to curtsey as they pass.
.pm new-page 030

Some day, some day when the spell is done
He will be a Prince again. <i>Won’t</i> that be fun?
He will come to seek me and kiss my lily hand
And take me on his foaming steed to reign in fairyland.

Sleep, oh sleep, for your days are long;
The stars shall sing you a slumber-song
Clear and bright as their silver flames,
All made up of their own sweet names,
Falling softly from star to star—
Mera, Murphid and Aladfar.

Sleep, oh sleep; with never a sound
We will circle mazily round and around;
We will wrap you close in a web of dreams
Shot with delicate fairy gleams;
.pm new-page 032
With our soft, soft wings we will brush away
The sorrowful darkness that comes with the day.

Sleep, oh sleep, for the night grows late;
Over the hill our comrades wait.
How can we go when the gifts we brought,
For all our loving, have served you nought?
How can we leave you and know you weep?
Will you not hush you, and smile, and sleep?

And what to say and what to do
If bogles ever bother you.

Came popping out and said “Good-day.”
But when we reached the little bend,

None shall light on a lovelier thing

This is the way the fairies dance:
They point their toes and they leap and prance
Over and under and round and round,
Now in the air and now on the ground,

To a wonderful music that nobody plays.
And swift their dance as the coming of spring,

And changing-bright as the peacock’s dye.

With a sharp thin tail sticking up like a spire,
While her mistress crouches over the fire,
Be the day cold or be the day hot,
Watching her strange little bubbling pot.

The gobliny dwarf that lives on the hill
He lies in the heather so still, so still.
But on big dark nights when there isn’t a moon
He puts on his cloak and his dancing shoon
And runs along like a soft shy mouse
Till he comes to the door of the witch’s house.
“Ho!” he cries, “it is junketing weather”;
And off they go on the spree together.
.pm new-page 045

Off they go on the tail of the wind:
The great black pussy-cat sails behind.
Haven’t you heard them banging about?
Haven’t you heard them whistle and shout?
Haven’t you seen them now and again
Peering in at the window-pane?
Oh, but I tell you it’s better to hide
When the witch and the goblin are out for a ride.

They move their lazy, lovely heads about,
They wave their arms, their hair goes streaming out,
Their rustling dresses shimmer like the sea.

But presently they cease to sway and swing
And stand quite still, and whisper gentle words,
Quietly calling to the little birds
To perch upon their pretty hands and sing.

Over the sky the darkness slid,
The stars all scuttled away and hid—

You may not see the fairies, but you know that they’re about,

Everything is different, everything is fun;
The sky is full of fairy clouds, the streets are fairy ways—

Some nights are fairy nights. Before you go to bed
You hear their darling music go chiming in your head;

You look into the garden, and through the misty grey
You see the trees all waiting in a breathless kind of way.
All the stars are smiling; they know that very soon
The fairies will come singing from the land behind the moon.
If only you could keep awake when Nurse puts out the light...
<i>Anything</i> might happen on a truly fairy night.

The boat was made of glass;
We sailed upon the little clouds,
The stars came out in shining crowds
So thick we scarce could pass.
But feather-light through all the night
About the sky we sped;
There were no oars with which to row,
There was no tiniest wind to blow
Though all the sails were spread.

They took me out a-sailing—
We anchored by the moon;
The golden door was open wide,
We saw a garden-ground inside
Where it was light as noon.
.pm new-page 057
And fairy folk looked out and spoke:
“Come in, come in and play!”
We climbed a little silver stair—
It was so beautiful in there
I wished that I might stay.

They took me out a-sailing—
Oh, strange the tales I heard
Of charmed adventures in the skies
Beyond the gaze of human eyes,
Beyond the flight of bird.
The stars went out, I looked about,
I saw the dewdrops gleam
Among the cobwebs on the lawn
As we came home at break of dawn...
It was not all a dream.

When friends come in to tea
In Fairyland it is the rule
To offer them a satin stool;
The grass is often very wet
And furniture is hard to get,
As you must all agree.

You’ve stolen all our mushrooms
And left not one behind.
If people came by night and day
And took your prettiest chairs away
And made them all into a stew
Without so much as thanking you,
Now would you call it kind?
.pm new-page 059

You’ve stolen all our mushrooms,
And, if you don’t take care,
We’ll go about the fields at night
And paint the toadstools brown and white,
And you’ll be punished for your greed
By being very ill indeed—
So you had best beware.
